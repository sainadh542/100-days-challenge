# 🔐 100 Days of Cybersecurity – Day 2

Today’s learning took me deeper into how systems actually talk on the internet.

From tracking suspicious login activity, I understood the real power of IP addresses and learned:

# IPv4 & IPv6

- Private vs Public IP ranges

- Domain names & domain hierarchy

- DNS and why it’s critical

- Ports and protocols

# This knowledge builds the foundation for:

- Tracing attackers

- Identifying active services on targets

- Understanding real-world network communication

Every day I’m getting closer to thinking like a security professional. 🚀
