# Day 4 – Web Fundamentals & HTTP Basics

Today I explored the core concepts that form the backbone of web communication and web security.

# Topics covered:

- Difference between HTTP and HTTPS

- Understanding URL structure and its components

- HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, etc.)

- Common HTTP status codes (200, 301, 404, 500…)

These fundamentals are essential for understanding how web applications communicate and how security vulnerabilities are discovered and mitigated.
Strong foundations before advanced security testing 🚀
