# 📅 Day 3 – OSINT & WHOIS Investigation
Today I analyzed a suspicious crypto investment website that promised unrealistic returns.
Instead of making assumptions, I performed a WHOIS lookup to uncover:


- Domain registrar details


- Hosting provider information


- Registration and expiry dates


- Contact and ownership records

This showed me how WHOIS becomes the first step in OSINT investigations — helping in tracking scam networks, connecting related fake websites, and preserving digital evidence for deeper analysis.
Every domain leaves a footprint. Today I learned how to read it. 🕵️‍♂️💻
