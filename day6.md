# 📅 Day 5 – 100 Days of Cybersecurity

Today I explored the core building blocks of networking that form the backbone of modern communication systems.

# 🔹 Topics Covered

- Network Topologies – Star, Bus, Ring & Mesh and how devices are logically arranged

- Switches – Connecting devices efficiently inside a network using intelligent packet forwarding

- Routers – Routing data between different networks and selecting the best delivery paths

Understanding these concepts strengthened my foundation in how data moves securely and efficiently across networks — a must-know for any cybersecurity professional.

Onward to Day 6! 💻🔥
