# Day 5 – DNS & HTTP Communication Fundamentals

Today I focused on understanding how browsers and servers actually communicate behind the scenes. These concepts form the base for web application security and vulnerability analysis.

# Topics covered:

- HTTP Headers and their role in client–server communication

- DNS Record Types (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, etc.)

- Step-by-step process of what happens when a DNS request is made

Learning how DNS resolution works and how headers control data flow is crucial for identifying misconfigurations, attacks like DNS spoofing, and web security flaws.
